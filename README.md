# Ceiling Collapse of Charles De Gaulle Airport-Terminal 2E, France
## DESCRIPTION OF BUILDING AND SIGNS OF FALURE BEFORE ACTUAL FALIURE
A 650 m long and 33 m wide tunnel made of concrete, glass and steel, collapsed.A 300 mm thick curved reinforced concrete precast slab was designed for the structure of 30 m width. Researchers suggested that a 30 m long concrete precast slab collapsed on to the boarding footpath. The accident occurred when most of the early morning flights had already disembarked, the hall was therefore partly deserted. According to witnesses, 5 minutes before the collapse, passengers and security staff noticed the appearance of a crack in the ceiling, in line with the departure lounge. Concrete dust started to fall at the same time as a crack was heard. One member of staff did not have time to warn the control station of the anomaly before the arch suddenly collapsed over a length of 30 m and width of 20 m.
## INVESTIGATION FINDINGS
The design concept used to construct the ceiling of the terminal was somewhat unusual. It was complex to understand and evaluate the force distribution since the 2D model made by the design office was not adequate as per code provisions. Redistribution of local forces from the struts to the panel was absent. Thus, the failure of a single member due to punching shear produced the collapse of domed concrete. 
In the zone of concrete failure, the composite panels seemed to be loaded by a higher level of roof loads, increasing the punching shear by 50%. Also, the structural model failed to take into account the long-term effects of terminal structure.

*  The quality of the assembled panels was affected due to the delay in executing the work. Also, the delay caused the misalignment between the composite panels of concrete. Therefore, the stresses were getting accumulated due to the eccentric loading on the composite panels. 
*  It was observed that the design error of the slab thickness was a trade-off due to the architectural requirement. The airport authorities themselves acted as the financier and the project manager. Thus, there was no external authority to check and regulate the project. 
*  Reports and investigations confirmed that the terminal ceiling failed due to the **poor practice of construction, low-quality concrete, and lack of structural design knowledge.**
On 14 february 2005, the Administrative Investigation Commission made its findings public: “the shell had been progressively weakened due to insufficient or incorrectly positioned reinforcements, a lack of mechanical redundancy (possibilities of load transfers to other areas in the event of local failure), weakness of the wall plate (supporting the shell over its whole length) and due to the position of the struts (metal parts supporting the glasswork) within the concrete”.
## REASONS OF FALIURE 
The following points describe the leading causes of the progressive collapse: 
*  Inadequate shear stiffness was developed due to the insufficient design of shear reinforcement. 
*  Dowel bars were deeply embedded inside the concrete shell and created cracks in the concrete roof. 
*  Several cracks were formed as a result of higher-than-expected construction loads and differential moisture and thermal movements.
*  Investigation reports suggested that the margin of safety was lesser than anticipated during the design. 
*  Cracks in concrete developed due to the misplacement of tensile reinforcement. Thus, the tensile stresses were not resisted effectively. 
*  The horizontal column ties and longitudinal support beams were inadequate to provide enough support to the structural members.
