# Ceiling Collapse of Charles De Gaulle Airport-Terminal 2E, France
## *DESCRIPTION OF BUILDING AND SIGNS OF FALURE BEFORE ACTUAL FALIURE
A 650 m long and 33 m wide tunnel made of concrete, glass and steel, collapsed. The accident occurred when most of the early morning flights had already disembarked, the hall was therefore partly deserted. According to witnesses, 5 minutes before the collapse, passengers and security staff noticed the appearance of a crack in the ceiling, in line with the departure lounge. Concrete dust started to fall at the same time as a crack was heard. One member of staff did not have time to warn the control station of the anomaly before the arch suddenly collapsed over a length of 30 m and width of 20 m.
